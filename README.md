# SOFTWARE_PyBank

## Why am I doing it?
In my second degree, I got very low money compared to my first degree, I will not detail here, but I come from 500€/month to 0.
So, I knew I could save better money for my second year, and to optimise my spendings, I've deecided to develop a budget management
Software tool custom-made, so I know my errors and I spend more wisely.

Of course, as I am a student and I want to be hired for the future, i'll try to develop this solution with the needs of the industry 
so I get more chances to get hired.
