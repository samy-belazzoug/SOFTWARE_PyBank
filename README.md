# SOFTWARE_PyBank

## Why am I doing it?
This was a project we had to so in school during my first degree.
But I've decided to go back again and do it properly.
This is the first software I entirely develop, from back-end to front-end.

It will also be a little laboratory for me to discover Python technologies.
I've discovered PyQT6, now Tkinter, and I am planning to go with Flask (or FastAPI) and Vue.js.

Moreover, this tool will be pretty useful for me, i'll finally have a proper tool for managing my money :)

## Tech stack

**Frameworks** : Flask + Vue.js
**Database** : SQLite
